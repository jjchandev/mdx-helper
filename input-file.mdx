A few years ago, I helped a friend launch a side hustle selling online coaching programs. 

We built her site, styled the brand, and set up her store. 

But when it came time to *actually accept payments*, the magic started to feel... technical. ü§Ø

"Wait, how do I collect credit cards?" she asked.

That moment introduced me to **Stripe** ‚Äî the tool that now powers payments for millions of businesses online, from side hustles to massive marketplaces.

So, in this post, I‚Äôm walking you through how to **accept payments using Stripe**, step by step ‚Äî with the same approach I took to help her.

No fluff. Just real code, real tools, and a real sense of *‚Äúhey, you‚Äôve got this.‚Äù*

## What Is Stripe, Really?

Stripe is a developer-first payments platform. 

It's like the engine behind checkout buttons on websites and apps you probably use every day ‚Äî like Notion, Substack, or Kickstarter.

The best part? You don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel.

Stripe gives you:

- Secure payment processing
- Fraud protection
- Prebuilt checkout flows
- Easy-to-use APIs

Let‚Äôs dive into setting this up like a pro ‚Äî without getting overwhelmed.

## Step 1: Setting Up Stripe

First things first: [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) if you haven‚Äôt already.

Once you're in, head over to your **Dashboard** to grab your **API keys**. These are like passwords that let your app talk to Stripe.

In test mode, you'll see two keys:

- **Publishable key**: For the frontend
- **Secret key**: For your server (keep this safe!)

```bash
# In your .env file
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...
```

## Step 2: Installing Stripe

Let‚Äôs get our backend set up. In this tutorial, we‚Äôre using Node.js, but you can adapt this for Python, Ruby, PHP, or whatever backend you‚Äôre comfortable with.

```bash
npm install stripe
```

Then, in your backend server:

```ts
// server.js or api/checkout.js
import Stripe from 'stripe';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
```

Cool, Stripe‚Äôs installed and ready to go.

## Step 3: Creating a Checkout Session

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre selling one product ‚Äî like a candle. Here‚Äôs how you can kick off a Stripe Checkout session.

```ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    mode: 'payment',
    line_items: [
      {
        price_data: {
          currency: 'usd',
          product_data: {
            name: 'Handmade Lavender Candle',
          },
          unit_amount: 2500, // in cents = $25.00
        },
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
    success_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/success',
    cancel_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/cancel',
  });

  res.status(200).json({ url: session.url });
}
```

That‚Äôs it. You call this endpoint from your frontend, and Stripe gives you a link that opens a secure, beautifully designed checkout page.

Pro tip: Use Stripe‚Äôs test card numbers to simulate payments. No real money involved.

## Bonus: Webhooks (a.k.a. Stripe Calling You Back)

Imagine your user pays ‚Äî how does your backend know?

That‚Äôs where webhooks come in. Stripe pings your server when events happen, like a payment succeeding.

ou can listen for those and trigger actions (e.g., send a confirmation email or unlock access).

```ts
import { buffer } from 'micro';

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

const endpointSecret = 'whsec_...';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const buf = await buffer(req);
  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];

  let event;

  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(buf, sig, endpointSecret);
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).send(`Webhook error: ${err.message}`);
  }

  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object;
    console.log('‚úÖ Payment succeeded for session:', session.id);
    // Do something awesome here
  }

  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
}
```

You can set up webhooks in your Stripe dashboard or locally using the Stripe CLI:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

If you followed along, you‚Äôve:

- Installed and configured Stripe
- Created a secure checkout session
- Learned how to react to payment events with webhooks

Now you‚Äôre not just selling products ‚Äî you're building real commerce workflows.

Stripe does an amazing job of letting you focus on what makes your business great ‚Äî not just on the plumbing underneath.

So go ahead, build that custom store, sell those digital downloads, or launch that course.
